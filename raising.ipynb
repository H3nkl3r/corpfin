    "* a pure acquisition company collecting funds via the IPO for an acquisition that eventually takes place at a later date\n",
    "* Typically, this acquisition must be realized within 18 to 24 months\n",
    "* if it is not realized, money (trust value) will be paid back to shareholders\n",
    "* If an acquisition target is identified, shareholders have to vote in favor of the acquisition (qualified majority). Dissenting shareholders can exit the SPAC at the trust value\n",
    "* Typically, SPAC sponsors hold about 20% of the shares at the time of the IPO. After the acquisition is consumed, these shares are converted into ordinary shares (vesting might depend on certain stock price thresholds). This significant dilution for outstanding shareholders.\n",
    "* Moreover, sponsors as well as ordinary shareholders hold warrants allowing them to buy additional shares after the acquisition is consumed.\n",
    "* Analyzing 94 SPACs worldwide, Kaserer/Kornherr (2022) show that their 12-month abnormal buy-and-hold return after the acquisition date is -24%"

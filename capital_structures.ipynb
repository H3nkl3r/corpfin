    "* To estimate the impact of debt overhang, we use the modeling of equity as an option on the firm value. If the company does an investment $I$ with a net present value of NPV, the firm value increases by $I + NPV $. This must equal the change in the equity and debt value, i.e. $ dV_E + dV_D = I + NPV $. Equity-holders will only invest if $ I < dV_E $ and hence, $ NPV > dV_D $. Bringing both inequalities together leads to:\n",

    "## The Cost of Risky Debt – Using the Option Pricing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though risky debt without bankruptcy costs does not alter the basic Modigliani-Miller results, it is still interesting how the cost of risky debt is affected by changes in the capital structure.\n",
    "- One way to solve this problem is to apply a structural model (e.g. Merton model), where equity is modeled as a call option on the firm value, i.e. $S = \\max[0, V - D]$.\n",
    "- Assumptions:\n",
    "  - Firm issues zero-coupon bonds that prohibit any capital distribution (such as dividend payments) until the bonds mature T time periods later.\n",
    "  - Firm value follows a geometric Brownian motion.\n",
    "  - No transaction costs or taxes:\n",
    "    - Thus, the value of the firm is unaffected by its capital structure.\n",
    "  - Risk-free interest rate is non-stochastic and known.\n",
    "  - Homogeneous expectations about the stochastic process of value of the firm’s assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the chapter on Financial Options, we have seen that by combining $\\Delta$ stocks with one shorted call we get a riskless portfolio (if $\\Delta$ is chosen appropriately).\n",
    "- Hence, by combining $\\Delta$ stocks with a riskless bond we get a call. The beta of this call is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\beta_C = \\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta S + B} \\beta_S + \\frac{B}{\\Delta S + B} \\beta_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, taking into account that the bond is riskless, i.e., beta is zero, and using the Merton model, i.e., interpreting the equity as a call option on the firm value, the equity beta can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\beta_E = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta V + V_D} \\beta_U = \\frac{\\Delta (V_E + V_D)}{V_E} \\beta_U = \\Delta \\left(1 + \\frac{V_D}{V_E}\\right) \\beta_U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that equity here is replicated by holding $(\\Delta)$ $\\times$ firm value and a riskless bond with a value equal to the debt value of the company. Hence, $\\Delta V + V_D = V_E$.\n",
    "- Also note that when corporate debt is riskless, equity (option on the firm value) is always in the money and hence, $\\Delta = 1$. In this case, the formula above is equal to the one on the slide before.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Holding all bonds and stocks yields a portfolio with a beta equal to the unlevered beta. Hence, it must hold for the debt beta:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\beta_D = (1 - \\Delta) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_E}{V_D}\\right) \\beta_U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of course, if debt is riskless, i.e., $\\Delta = 1$, the debt beta is zero.\n",
    "- However, if debt is not riskless and by taking into account that in the Merton model $\\Delta = N(d_1)$, asset, equity, and debt beta can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\beta_E = N(d_1) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_D}{V_E}\\right) \\beta_U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\beta_D = N(-d_1) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_E}{V_D}\\right) \\beta_U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\beta_U = \\frac{\\beta_E}{N(d_1)\\left(1 + \\frac{V_D}{V_E}\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, we can substitute the result for the equity beta into the CAPM formula. This yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$r_E = r_f + N(d_1) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_D}{V_E}\\right) \\beta_U (r_m - r_f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, because betas are proportional to risk premia, it must hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\frac{r_U - r_f}{r_m - r_f} = \\beta_U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using this result, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$r_E = r_f + N(d_1) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_D}{V_E}\\right) (r_U - r_f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, we can derive for the cost of debt:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$r_D = r_f + N(-d_1) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_E}{V_D}\\right) (r_U - r_f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of course, by calculating the weighted average of $r_E$ and $r_D$, we will get $r_U$, i.e., the cost of the unlevered firm. The proof is left to the interested students.\n"
